        <h1>Welcome!</h1>
        <p>
            Hi there! I'm Marcus Aurileus Shaw, a full-stack developer. 
            This is where I showcase the projects I've worked on and share a bit about myself.

            <h2>About Me</h2>

            I’m building responsive, accessible web applications using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and modern tooling, with a focus on clean code, 
            practical problem-solving and continuous improvement. 
            With a military-trained mindset and experience supporting users and systems, I bring reliability,

                <h3>Dasamoto Art</h3>
                <p>I built a simple, single-page website for the fictional store “Dasmoto’s Arts & Crafts” using HTML and CSS.
                     I set up a clear project folder structure, 
                    linked an external stylesheet, and added all required images as assets. 
                    The page is laid out with semantic sections for each product category (Brushes, Frames, Paint), 
                    styled to match the provided design spec, including the large patterned header, category colour banners, 
                    consistent typography, and highlighted pricing. 
                    I also added in-page anchor links so users can jump to each section smoothly.</p>

                <h3>Message Generator</h3>
                <p>I wrote the JavaScript that powers the “Number Guesser” game by wiring up the UI to the game logic. 
                    When the player clicks Make a Guess, the script generates a target number, reads the player’s input, 
                    creates a random computer guess, compares which guess is closest to the target, updates and displays the scores, 
                    and shows the winner on the page. It also manages the round flow by disabling/enabling the correct buttons, 
                    resetting the input and display values for the next round, 
                    and adding plus/minus controls that keep the user’s guess within the allowed range.</p>

                <h3>TeaCozy</h3>
                <p>I built a multi-section index page for “The Tea Cozy” using HTML and CSS, 
                    styled to match a dark, minimalist brand. The site includes a sticky header with logo and navigation links, 
                    a hero “Mission” section with a full-width background image and overlaid text, a “Tea of the Month” gallery laid out with Flexbox, 
                    and a locations section presented as three clear content blocks over a background image. 
                    I used consistent typography and spacing throughout, removed default list styling for cleaner layouts, 
                    and structured the page so content is easy to scan and visually consistent across sections</p>

                <h3>MartialArtsDojo</h3>
                <p>I built a responsive website for a martial arts dojo using HTML and CSS, 
                    focused on clean structure and a confident, modern look. 
                    The site includes a clear header with navigation that jumps to sections on the same page, 
                    a hero area to communicate the dojo’s identity and values, and dedicated sections for class information such as timetable, 
                    training styles, instructor bios and contact details. I used Flexbox to keep layouts consistent and aligned, 
                    ensured images scale properly, and added responsive styling so the page stays readable and well spaced across mobile, 
                    tablet and desktop screen sizes.</p>
